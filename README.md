# Weather

A local weather checker made as an assignment for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/).

## Resources

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/)
- [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
- [ipapi](https://ipapi.co/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## How it works

An AJAX request gets a JSON response from ipapi containing the location data. Then another request gets a JSON response from OpenWeatherMap containing the weather data, with the location parameters passed to it. Register for free to get the required OpenWeatherMap app ID.

## Note

No live preview because of OpenWeatherMap API key.
